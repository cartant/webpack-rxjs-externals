# webpack-rxjs-externals

Utility to generate all the ["externals"](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals/#externals) for your webpack config.

Since RxJS is ever-changing, this removes the need to maintain a list, instead generating it on the fly.

**Requires webpack v2**

#### webpack.config.js

```js
import webpackRxjsExternals from 'webpack-rxjs-externals';

export default {
  externals: [
    webpackRxjsExternals(),
    // other externals here
  ]
};
```

If the `let` operator is used, an alias needs to be configured, as the exported name (`letProto`) differs from the prototype name (`let`):

```js
import webpackRxjsExternals from 'webpack-rxjs-externals';

export default {
  externals: [
    webpackRxjsExternals(),
    // other externals here
  ],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      ...webpackRxjsExternals.alias(),
      // other aliases here
    }
  }
};
```
